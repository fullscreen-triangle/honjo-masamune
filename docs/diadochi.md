# Diadochi: Model Combination Engine

## Overview

The Diadochi module is an advanced model combination engine that intelligently combines domain-expert models to produce superior expert domains. Named after the successors of Alexander the Great who divided his empire among themselves, this module orchestrates multiple AI models to achieve better results through collaboration and strategic combination.

## Etymology and Concept

**Diadochi** (διάδοχοι) means "successors" in ancient Greek. Just as Alexander's generals combined their individual strengths to rule different territories while maintaining the greater empire, the Diadochi engine combines the specialized knowledge of domain experts to tackle complex, interdisciplinary problems that no single model could solve alone.

## Core Architecture

The Diadochi engine implements five fundamental architectural patterns for model combination:

### 1. Router-Based Ensembles
- **Purpose**: Direct queries to the most appropriate domain expert
- **Use Case**: When queries can be clearly categorized into distinct domains
- **Advantage**: High efficiency and specialization
- **Cost**: 50 ATP base + 200 ATP per expert

```rust
// Route a query to the best biomechanics expert
let result = engine.router_ensemble_combination(
    "What's the optimal stride frequency for sprinting?",
    "default_router"
).await?;
```

### 2. Sequential Chaining
- **Purpose**: Pass queries through multiple experts in sequence, building on previous insights
- **Use Case**: Problems requiring progressive analysis across domains
- **Advantage**: Deep, layered analysis with contextual building
- **Cost**: 100 ATP base + 150 ATP per expert in chain

```rust
// Chain biomechanics → physiology → nutrition analysis
let result = engine.sequential_chain_combination(
    "How can I optimize sprint performance and recovery?",
    "default_chain"
).await?;
```

### 3. Mixture of Experts
- **Purpose**: Process through multiple experts in parallel, then synthesize responses
- **Use Case**: Queries requiring integrated insights from multiple domains
- **Advantage**: Comprehensive perspective with intelligent weight balancing
- **Cost**: 100 ATP base + 200 ATP per active expert + 100 ATP synthesis

```rust
// Get parallel insights from multiple sports science experts
let result = engine.mixture_of_experts_combination(
    "What factors affect sprint performance across training, nutrition, and biomechanics?",
    "default_mixture"
).await?;
```

### 4. Specialized System Prompts
- **Purpose**: Use a single powerful model with multi-domain expertise prompts
- **Use Case**: When tight integration is needed or computational resources are limited
- **Advantage**: Coherent integration with lower computational overhead
- **Cost**: 75 ATP prompt construction + 300 ATP generation

```rust
// Use integrated multi-domain system prompt
let result = engine.system_prompt_combination(
    "Explain the relationship between muscle fiber types and optimal training periodization",
    "default_system_prompt"
).await?;
```

### 5. Knowledge Distillation
- **Purpose**: Train a single student model from multiple teacher experts
- **Use Case**: Production environments requiring fast inference with stable domains
- **Advantage**: Deployment efficiency with retained multi-domain knowledge
- **Cost**: Setup and training overhead, but efficient runtime

```rust
// Setup knowledge distillation for production deployment
let setup_result = engine.setup_knowledge_distillation("sports_science_distillation").await?;
```

## Intelligent Pattern Selection

The Diadochi engine can automatically select the most appropriate combination pattern based on query analysis:

```rust
// Let the engine decide the best combination strategy
let result = engine.intelligent_model_combination(
    "How does sprint biomechanics interact with metabolic demands during different training phases?"
).await?;
```

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Complexity < 0.3**: Router-based ensemble (simple, domain-specific queries)
- **Complexity 0.3-0.6**: System prompts (moderate complexity)
- **Complexity 0.6-0.8**: Sequential chaining (complex, progressive analysis)
- **Complexity > 0.8**: Mixture of experts (highly complex, multi-domain queries)

## Configuration

### Domain Experts
Configure available domain experts with their specializations:

```yaml
diadochi:
  enabled: true
  default_experts:
    - name: "biomechanics"
      domain: "biomechanics"
      specialization: ["kinematics", "kinetics", "motor_control"]
      confidence_threshold: 0.8
      performance_score: 0.85
    
    - name: "physiology"
      domain: "physiology"
      specialization: ["exercise_physiology", "metabolism", "cardiovascular"]
      confidence_threshold: 0.8
      performance_score: 0.82
```

### Router Strategies
Define how queries are routed to appropriate experts:

```yaml
router_strategies:
  default_router:
    strategy_type: "embedding"  # Options: keyword, embedding, classifier, llm
    threshold: 0.7
    keywords:
      biomechanics: ["movement", "force", "kinetics"]
      physiology: ["muscle", "energy", "metabolism"]
      nutrition: ["diet", "protein", "carbohydrate"]
```

### Chain Configurations
Configure sequential processing chains:

```yaml
chain_configurations:
  default_chain:
    expert_sequence: ["biomechanics", "physiology", "nutrition"]
    max_context_length: 4000
    summarization_threshold: 2000
    context_strategy: "Summarized"  # Options: Full, Summarized, KeyPoints, Selective, Hierarchical
```

### Mixture Configurations
Configure parallel expert processing:

```yaml
mixture_configurations:
  default_mixture:
    experts: ["biomechanics", "physiology", "nutrition"]
    weighting_strategy: "Softmax"  # Options: Binary, Linear, Softmax, Learned
    synthesis_method: "LLMSynthesis"  # Options: WeightedConcatenation, ExtractiveSynthesis, LLMSynthesis, Hierarchical
    confidence_estimator: "Embedding"  # Options: Embedding, Keyword, Classifier, LLMBased
```

## Response Quality Metrics

The Diadochi engine tracks several quality metrics:

### Integration Coherence
Measures how well different expert insights are integrated:
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Seamless integration, no contradictions
- **Medium (0.6-0.8)**: Good integration with minor inconsistencies
- **Low (0.0-0.6)**: Poor integration, significant contradictions

### Response Quality
Overall quality assessment based on multiple factors:
- **Expert performance scores**: Individual expert reliability
- **Context preservation**: How well context is maintained through processing
- **Synthesis effectiveness**: Quality of final response synthesis

### Pattern Performance
Different patterns excel in different scenarios:
- **Router Ensembles**: Highest single-domain accuracy (0.95+)
- **Sequential Chains**: Best for progressive complexity (0.85-0.90)
- **Mixture of Experts**: Optimal cross-domain integration (0.88-0.92)
- **System Prompts**: Good general integration (0.82-0.87)

## ATP Cost Management

The Diadochi engine integrates with the ATP system for energy management:

```yaml
atp_costs:
  router_cost: 50
  chain_cost_per_expert: 150
  mixture_base_cost: 100
  mixture_cost_per_expert: 200
  system_prompt_cost: 75
  synthesis_cost: 100
```

**Cost Optimization Strategies:**
1. **Router Ensembles**: Most ATP-efficient for single-domain queries
2. **System Prompts**: Good balance of quality and efficiency
3. **Sequential Chains**: Higher cost but superior depth for complex queries
4. **Mixture of Experts**: Highest cost but best for multi-domain integration

## Performance Statistics

```rust
let stats = engine.get_diadochi_statistics().await;
println!("Total combinations: {}", stats.total_combinations);
println!("Average integration coherence: {:.3}", stats.average_integration_coherence);
println!("Pattern usage: {:?}", stats.pattern_usage);
println!("Expert utilization: {:?}", stats.expert_utilization);
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Total Combinations**: Number of model combinations performed
- **Pattern Usage**: Distribution of architectural pattern usage
- **Expert Utilization**: How frequently each expert is used
